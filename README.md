## Why?

> tl;dr: it's a super useful pre-processing step before deeper compliance review.

- instant feedback: files are parsed in-browser, so summaries appear as soon as the file is uploaded to client, with no network roundâ€‘trip.
  
- zero usage fees: unlike GPTâ€‘4 (at $0.01â€“$0.06 per 1â€¯K tokens), this tool runs locally - no perâ€‘document billing.
  
- pre-filter: by using this tool as an entry-point, you can extract core clauses clientâ€‘side, and drastically cut down the tokens sent to an LLM, consequently reducing spend.
  
**by embedding this lightweight parser as the first step into a larger workflow automation software, you gain speed and costâ€‘efficiency, creating a bestâ€‘ofâ€‘bothâ€‘worlds pipeline: instant, ruleâ€‘based parsing up front, and aiâ€‘driven analysis where it matters most.**

note that the limitation here is that it wonâ€™t scale for bulk document processing. if you need to process hundreds of docs in parallel or work with large-scale datasets, this solution wouldnâ€™t fit that use case. itâ€™s meant for individual cases or smaller-scale operationsâ€”like checking a couple of contracts or policies quickly.

## How?

- upload `sample.txt`
- click `View Report`
- report will be identical to `output.txt`
- instant, zeroâ€‘cost document processing + summarization
